# Name of application: Dr. Love

**Project Overview**

*Collaborated with peers to design a comprehensive and flexible mobile application interface. 

*The application we designed is a dating advice application that allows users to share their experiences, insight, and point of view about relationship topics, issues, and Ideas. 

*The user interacts with the application as one would with a social media application where they are able to make friends, chat, and message their friends, and scroll along a main feed. 

*This allows for our users to learn from the ideas and input of other users. This application is designed to be a touch interface, where all expected inputs will be through the devicesâ€™ touch screen ability.
